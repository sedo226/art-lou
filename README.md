:art: **A Front-End Development Project**

This is a front-end development project created to practice/test my newly acquired skills in various front end languages (i.e. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ajax, JQuery, etc.). 

This particular project is an idea I had for an 'etsy like' web application, specifically for Louisville artists and art enthusiasts. 

Use for Artists: the idea is that local Louisville artists can sign up and sell there work on the app (this feature is not yet implemented)

Use for Art Enthusiast: people looking to purchase (or simply looking explore and appreciate) local art could come and navigate the side, learn more about local artists, and procure art via online purchase.

The majority of the functionality has not yet been implemented - for this stage in the project I focused mainly on the basic UI structure for the Home and Gallery pages. As the project stands, you should be able to navigate to the Gallery page and sort (placeholder) artwork by desired Medium. You can also favorite pieces of artwork by clicking on the heart icon (located at the top right corner of each piece if viewing on Desktop). 

There are a few steps required to view this project as I have chosen not to publish it until more functionality is included (hopefully soon!). Please follow the steps below and if you run into any error feel free to email me (serra.pres.doll@gmail.com). I hope you enjoy!
